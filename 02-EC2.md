# EC2
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.
* If the Spot instance if terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.

## Four Types of Instances
* On Demand - Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
* Reserved - Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. Contract Terms are 1 year or 3 year terms.
* Spot - Enabled you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
* Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
* Standard Reserved Instances cannot be moved between regions. You can choose if a Reserved Instance applies to either a specific Availability Zone, or an Entire Region, but you cannot change the region

# EBS
* Termination Protection is **turned off** by default, you must turn it on.
* On an EBS- backed instance, the **default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted** when the instance is terminated.
* EBS Root Volumes of your default AMI's **can** be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker etc) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMI's (remember the lab) in the AWS console or using the API.
* Additional volumes can be encrypted.

## EBS Snapshots
* Volumes exist on EBS. Think of EBS as a virtual hard disk.
* Snapshots exist on S3. Think of snapshots as a photograph of the disk.
* Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes.
* Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.
* If this is your first snapshot, it may take some time to create.
* To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
* However, you can take a snap while the instance is running.
* You can create AMI's from both Volumes and Snapshots.
* You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and storage type.
* Volumes will **always** be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance.

## Migrating EBS
* To move an EC2 volume from one Availability Zone to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then use the AMI to launch the EC2 instance in a new Availability Zone.
* To move an EC2 volume from one region to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then copy the AMI from one region to the other. Then use the copied AMI to launch the new EC2 instance in the new region.

## EBS Encryption
* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
* Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically.
* You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted.
* These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public.
* Root device volumes can now be encrypted. If you have an unencrypted root device volume that needs to be encrypted, do the following: 
    - Create a Snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume.
    - Create a copy of the Snapshot and select the encrypt option.
    - Create an AMI from the encrypted Snapshot.
    - Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.

## Compare EBS Types
| Volume Type | Description | Use Cases | API Name | Volume Size | Max. IOPS**/Volume |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| General Purpose SSD | General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety or transactional workloads | Most Work Loads | gp2 | 1 GiB - 16 TiB | 16, 000 |
| Provisioned IOPS SSD | Highest-performance SSD volume designed for mission-critical applications | Databases | io1 | 4 GiB - 16 TiB | 64,000
| Throughput Optimized HDD | Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads | Big Data & Data Warehouses | st1 | 500 GiB - 16 TiB | 500 |
| Cold HDD | Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads | File Servers | sc1 | 500 GiB - 16 TiB | 250 |
| EBS Magnetic | Previous generation HDD | Workloads where data is infrequently accessed | Standard | 1 GiB - 1 TiB | 40 - 200 |

# Security Groups
* All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
* All outbound traffic is allowed.
* Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.
* You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group.
* You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 Instances.
* Security Groups are **Stateful**.
* If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again.
* You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists (Network ACLs).
* You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

# EBS vs Instance Store
* Instance store volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage.
* Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.
* EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.
* You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.
* By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination. However with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.

# Encrypting Root Device Volumes
* Create a Snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume.
* Create a copy of the Snapshot and select the encrypt option.
* Create an AMI from the encrypted Snapshot.
* Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.

# Enhanced Networking
* ENI - For basic networking. Perhaps you need a separate management network to your production network or a separate logging network and you need to do this at low cost. IN this scenario use multiple ENIs for each network.
* Enhanced Network - For when you need speeds between 10Gps and 100Gps. Anywhere you need reliable, high throughput.
* Elastic Fabric Adaptor - For when you need to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications or if you need to do an OS by-pass. If you see a scenario question mentioning HPC or ML and asking what network adaptor you want, choose EFA.
* Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. Reference: Enhanced networking on Linux.

# CloudWatch
* CloudWatch is used for monitoring performance.
* CloudWatch can monitor most of AWS as well as your applications that run on AWS.
* CloudWatch with EC2 will monitor events every 5 minutes by default.
* You can have 1 minute intervals by turning on detailed monitoring.
* You can create CloudWatch alarms which trigger notifications.
* CloudWatch is all about performance. CloudTrail is all about auditing.
* CloudWatch monitors performance.
* CloudTrail monitors API calls in the AWS platform.

## What can you do with CloudWatch?
* **Dashboards** - Creates awesome dashboards to see what is happening with your AWS environment.
* **Alarms** - Allows you to set alarms that notify you when particular thresholds are hit.
* **Events** - CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resource.
* **Logs** - CloudWatch logs helps you to aggregate, monitor and store logs.

# AWS CLI
* You can interact with AWS from anywhere in the world just by using the command line (CLI).
* You will need to set up access in IAM.
* Commands themselves are not in the exam but some basic commands will be useful to know for real life.

# Roles
* Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instances.
* Roles are easier to manage.
* Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance after it is created using both the console & command line.
* Roles are universal - you can use them in any region.

# Bootstrap Scripts
* Bootstrap scripts run when an EC2 instance first boots.
* Can be a powerful way of automating software installs and updates.

# Instance Meta Data & User Data
* Used to get information about an instance (such as public ip)
* Get user data - http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
* Get meta data - http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
* Get host name - http://169.254.169.254/latest/hostname
* Get mac address - http://169.254.169.254/latest/mac

# EFS
* Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol.
* You only pay for the storage you use. (no pre-provisioning required)
* Can scale up to the petabytes.
* Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.
* Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones within a region.
* Read after Write consistency.

# Different Storage Mechanism
* **EFS** - When you need distributed, highly resilient storage for Linux instances and Linux-based applications.
* **Amazon FSx for Windows** - When you need centralized storage for Windows based applications such as Sharepoint, Microsoft SQL Server, Workspaces, IIS Web Server or any other native Microsoft Application. (Look out for SMB Storage)
* **Amazon FSx for Lustre** - When you need high-speed, high-capacity distributed storage. This will be for applications that do High Performance Compute (HPC), financial modeling etc. Remember that FSx for Lustre can store data directly on S3.
* Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system so you can easily move your Windows-based applications that require shared file storage to AWS. EBS Multi Attach allows you to attach a volume to up to 16 instances, but would have issues across multiple availability zones, and could not use NTFS natively. EFS uses the NFS protocol, and is explicitly not supported on Windows. S3 is object-based storage, and would not be suitable as the backend for a file server

# EC2 Placement Groups
* **Clustered Placement Group** - Low Network Latency / High Network Throughput. When all EC2 instances are in the same Availability Zone. 
* **Spread Placement Group** - Individual Critical EC2 instances. In different AZs and hardware.
* **Partitioned** - Multiple EC2 instances HDFS, HBase and Cassandra. Each partition will be on separate racks and hardware.
* A clustered placement group can't span multiple AZs.
* A spread placement and partitioned group can span multiple AZs.
* The name you specify for a placement group must be unique within your AWS account.
* Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (Compute Optimized, GPU, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized)
* AWS recommend homogenous instances within clustered placement groups.
* AWS now allows you to move an existing instance into a placement group.
