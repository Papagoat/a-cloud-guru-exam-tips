# EC2
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.
* If the Spot instance if terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.

## Four types of instances
* On Demand - Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
* Reserved - Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. Contract Terms are 1 year or 3 year terms.
* Spot - Enabled you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
* Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

# EBS
* Termination Protection is **turned off** by default, you must turn it on.
* On an EBS- backed instance, the **default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted** when the instance is terminated.
* EBS Root Volumes of your default AMI's **can** be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker etc) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMI's (remember the lab) in the AWS console or using the API.
* Additional volumes can be encrypted.

## EBS Snapshots
* Volumes exist on EBS. Think of EBS as a virtual hard disk.
* Snapshots exist on S3. Think of snapshots as a photograph of the disk.
* Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes.
* Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.
* If this is your first snapshot, it may take some time to create.
* To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
* However, you can take a snap while the instance is running.
* You can create AMI's from both Volumes and Snapshots.
* You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and storage type.
* Volumes will **always** be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance.

## Migrating EBS
* To move an EC2 volume from one AZ to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then use the AMI to launch the EC2 instance in a new AZ.
* To move an EC2 volume from one region to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then copy the AMI from one region to the other. Then use the copied AMI to launch the new EC2 instance in the new region.

## EBS Encryption
* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
* Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically.
* You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted.
* These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public.
* Root device volumes can now be encrypted. If you have an unencrypted root device volume that needs to be encrypted, do the following: 
    - Create a Snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume.
    - Create a copy of the Snapshot and select the encrypt option.
    - Create an AMI from the encrypted Snapshot.
    - Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.

## Compare EBS Types
| Volume Type | Description | Use Cases | API Name | Volume Size | Max. IOPS**/Volume |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| General Purpose SSD | General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety or transactional workloads | Most Work Loads | gp2 | 1 GiB - 16 TiB | 16, 000 |
| Provisioned IOPS SSD | Highest-performance SSD volume designed for mission-critical applications | Databases | io1 | 4 GiB - 16 TiB | 64,000
| Throughput Optimized HDD | Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads | Big Data & Data Warehouses | st1 | 500 GiB - 16 TiB | 500 |
| Cold HDD | Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads | File Servers | sc1 | 500 GiB - 16 TiB | 250 |
| EBS Magnetic | Previous generation HDD | Workloads where data is infrequently accessed | Standard | 1 GiB - 1 TiB | 40 - 200 |

# Security Groups
* All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
* All outbound traffic is allowed.
* Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.
* You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group.
* You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 Instances.
* Security Groups are **Stateful**.
* If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again.
* You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists (Network ACLs).
* You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

# EBS vs Instance Store
* Instance store volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage.
* Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.
* EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.
* You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.
* By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination. However with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
